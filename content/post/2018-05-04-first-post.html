<h1>New Home</h1>
<p>Hi there - how do you like the new digs? After a brief hiatus during grad school application season, I found myself ready to dive back into data, but extremely frustrated with GitHub documents as a medium to share my work. Enter blogdown and GitHub Pages! The blogdown R package makes it easy to create a website using nothing but R Markdown, and then host it on your free personal GitHub URL.</p>
<p>This page is <em>miles</em> better than what I was originally using: it’s highly customizable, compatible with other HTML elements, and doesn’t require bending over backwards to publish attractive code. Don’t be surprised to see tweaks the site appearance as I continue to play with the design. Tyler Clavelle’s <a href="https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/">article</a> was indispensable in the setup process, I highly recommend checking it out if you would like to create your own page.</p>
<p>Anyway, watch this space for posts sometime later this month. For posterity, you can access my two previous write-ups using the links below:</p>
