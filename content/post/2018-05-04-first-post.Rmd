# New Home

Hi there - how do you like the new digs? After a brief hiatus during grad school application season, I found myself ready to dive back into data, but extremely frustrated with GitHub documents as a medium to share my work. Enter blogdown and GitHub Pages! The blogdown R package makes it easy to create a website using nothing but R Markdown, and then host it on your free personal GitHub URL.

This page is *miles* better than what I was originally using: it's highly customizable, compatible with other HTML elements, and doesn't require bending over backwards to publish attractive code. Don't be surprised to see tweaks to the site's appearance as I continue to play with the design. Tyler Clavelle's [article](https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/) was indispensable in the setup process; I highly recommend checking it out if you would like to create your own page.

Anyway, watch this space for posts sometime later this month. For posterity, you can access my two previous write-ups using the links below:

* [Divvy rides in 2016](https://github.com/sean-connelly/Divvy/blob/master/Divvy.md)
* [What would SB 827 (RIP) look like in NYC?](https://github.com/sean-connelly/Zoning/blob/master/Zoning.md)
